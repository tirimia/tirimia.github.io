While I have matured since then and have been in multiple relationships with varying degrees of success, I find myself coming back to it time and time again. Now, obviously, with the added benefit of experience and a more polished vocabulary.\n\nThis model is meant as a simple way to \"debug\" issues in relationships and/or explain why some work so well while others crash and burn. My partner and I even use it as the foundation of our relationship quarterly reviews, more on that later.\n\n## Imagery\n\nImagine, if you will, a three-legged barstool. You're at a bar, want to sit down, so you prop yourself up on one of these puppies and good times ensue. After a while, you feel the need to move around a bit and shift in your seat. No problem, your stool is stable as can be, and you know it will continue supporting you.\n\nHowever, you glance to your side and see your buddy Archibald Archibaldovich and he's holding on to the bar top for dear life. Oh noes, what's going on ?! Well, turns out Archie's stool has one leg much shorter than the other two... Of course he has to put in effort to stay on, he can't focus on enjoying his Maple Old Fashioned, and he's bound to fall off sooner rather than later and fracture something during the inevitable collision with the dirty floor.\n\n## Principle\n\nA relationship has three legs:\n  - Intellectual\n  - Emotional\n  - Sexual\n\n\u003Cmark>Any configuration except for three long, equally-sized, solid legs is a recipe for discomfort and worst case, \u003Cmark class=\"alt-mark\">misery.\u003C/mark>\u003C/mark>\n\n### Intellectual\n#### Personal goals\n#### Career ambition\n### Emotional\n#### Trust\n#### Presence\n### Sexual\n#### Frequency\n#### Kinks\n\n## Using it in a relationship review\nNo matter the level of your compatibility, as time progresses, the stressors of life and their lazy friend, Habit, take their toll. I find it irresponsible to not have a set procedure for looking back on various timespans and acknowledging and praising the good, while setting goals and guardrails against the suboptimal.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> \u003Cmark class=\"alt-mark\">_DO NOT_\u003C/mark> LEAVE ISSUES FOR THE RELATIONSHIP REVIEW\n>\n> Deal with them as they arise; reviews are, as the name suggests, for looking _back_\n\nGiven my years in a corporate environment (which weirdly includes high-school, topic for another article), I have been exposed to/subjected to/inflicted review cycles. They are stressful procedures, regardless of how well they turn out in the end.\n\nI thank my lucky stars I have found a partner that agrees on the importance on implementing a similar process for relationships. Not only do we agree they are necessary, we find it quite \u003Cmark>romantic\u003C/mark>.\u003Cbr/> How, you ask? Well, Bruno Mars can keep [listing all the hypothetical deadly dangers](https://genius.com/Bruno-mars-grenade-lyrics) he'd subject himself to for love, I will prove my love with the romantic gesture of applying _actual_ effort and intent to keeping the relationship healthy, no matter how annoying and/or boring the proess may prove to be (ironically, doing this process often keeps the stakes low and discussions always end up fun).","src/content/articles/barstool_relationship_model.mdx","3109a942d8de4d5a","barstool_relationship_model.mdx",true,"empathy_driven_development",{"id":22,"data":24,"body":28,"filePath":29,"digest":30,"legacyId":31,"deferredRender":21},{"title":25,"subtitle":26,"publishedAt":27},"Empathy Driven Development","Understanding others and your past self",["Date","2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z"],"How often have you opened a file, seen something you dislike greatly, then started cussing at the git blame?\n\nFor total transparency: that used to be me all the time.\n\n\u003Cmark class=\"alt-mark\">As the adage goes: If everyone else seems to be the problem, it's you who is the problem.\u003C/mark>\n\nKeeping that in mind, and as an exercise in pre-emptive empathy, I devised some methods by which I can keep my sanity while working on a shared codebase that I will now share with you in the hopes that they will serve you too.\n\n## Understanding\n### Context\n\nTo better think of the context that code was written in, ask yourself the following questions:\n      - was the PO cracking the whip especially hard for that feature?\n      - did the author receive proper onboarding in the team's style or (god-forbid) the programming language/paradigm itself?\n      - were the specifications for that feature remotely intelligible?\n      - what is actually the blast radius of the perceived problem?\n      - what was your level of experience at when writing that ?\n\n## Prevention\n\nPersonally, if I go through anything I consider unpleasant, I strive to make the world a better place by preventing others from experiencing the same.\n\n### Form a connection with the reader/reviewer\nWe all know when we're cutting corners or are simply working around our ignorance. \u003Cmark>Don't be ashamed of it\u003C/mark>. If you find yourself in a position to write code you know is not remotely close to your best, or maybe just confusing due to the structure you find yourself force into, _leave a comment_.\n\nComments don't take long to write, and the moment someone else lays eyes on your work, they can immediately empathize with your pain. Moreover, if your comment is descriptive enough, you've just saved them a bunch of time they would have otherwise spent researching, reading and/or cursing your name. This way, you have turned potential frustration into gratitude and cameraderie.","src/content/articles/empathy_driven_development.mdx","0f42ec4603fc5d44","empathy_driven_development.mdx","go_is_a_bad_friend",{"id":32,"data":34,"body":37,"filePath":38,"digest":39,"legacyId":40,"deferredRender":21},{"title":35,"publishedAt":36},"Go is a bad friend ☹️",["Date","2024-11-11T00:00:00.000Z"],"import Gonger from './assets/Gonger.png';\n\nNot everyone whom you've called a friend at some point or another has been a good friend.

You don't need to feel uneasy navigating things like Rust's lifetimes or Lisp's lack of `return`, or god-forbid, Gleam's lack of mutability 😱.\n#### Very knowledgeable\nThe sheer amount of libraries out there is mind-blowing, and the community is very welcoming and supportive.
