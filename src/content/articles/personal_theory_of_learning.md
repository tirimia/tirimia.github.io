Learning-wise, I have had the paradoxical misfortune of being a gifted child during school. Why is it a misfortune, you ask? Well, the moment you hit college, less and less knowledge can be picked up intuitively, and now you're burdened with a brain that is not accustomed to the work and practices necessary to keep up. Layer a bruised ego on top of that, and nobody's having fun.

Multiple years of struggles later, I am pretty happy with my learning pace and the breadth of my interests. I also get to train tech apprentices in the [German vocational training system](https://www.bmbf.de/EN/Education/Training/training_node.html), so I get to experiment and observe what helps people learn faster with lasting effects. In the interest of not having to relearn my own observations, and sharing my lessons with those who are struggling or are simply curious, this article will document the important factors in learning. -- rephrase this

## - Relearning
Every time you relearn a concept, it goes by faster. This, however, is no reason to keep doing it needlessly. Push yourself to cement knowledge as you acquire it
## + Iterate: quick and cheap
Nothing forms connections faster than experience. It then makes sense to accelerate how fast "experience" is gained.

You need to drive down the cost (time and mental load) of iterations. Example: you are learning a new programming language or a library. Prioritize setting up testing. Make the project give you near-instant feedback on the functionality you're trying to implement.
## Describe it in your own words
As previously mentioned, I am writing this article so I don't have to relearn
