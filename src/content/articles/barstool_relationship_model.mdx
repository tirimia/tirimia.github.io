# Work in progress ⚠️
Back in my teenage years, trying to grasp the complexity of the world, fueled by hubris and an enthusiasm for good metaphors, I came up with the barstool relationship model. While I have matured since then and have been in multiple relationships with varying degrees of success, I find myself coming back to it time and time again. Now, obviously, with the added benefit of experience and a more polished vocabulary.

This model is meant as a simple way to "debug" issues in relationships and/or explain why some work so well while others crash and burn. My partner and I even use it as the foundation of our relationship quarterly reviews, more on that later.

## Imagery

Imagine, if you will, a three-legged barstool. You're at a bar, want to sit down, so you prop yourself up on one of these puppies and good times ensue. After a while, you feel the need to move around a bit and shift in your seat. No problem, your stool is stable as can be, and you know it will continue supporting you.

However, you glance to your side and see your buddy Archibald Archibaldovich and he's holding on to the bar top for dear life. Oh noes, what's going on ?! Well, turns out Archie's stool has one leg much shorter than the other two... Of course he has to put in effort to stay on, he can't focus on enjoying his Maple Old Fashioned, and he's bound to fall off sooner rather than later and fracture something during the inevitable collision with the dirty floor.

## Principle

A relationship has three legs:
  - Intellectual
  - Emotional
  - Sexual

<mark>Any configuration except for three long, equally-sized, solid legs is a recipe for discomfort and worst case, <mark class="alt-mark">misery.</mark></mark>

### Intellectual
#### Personal goals
#### Career ambition
### Emotional
#### Trust
#### Presence
### Sexual
#### Frequency
#### Kinks

## Using it in a relationship review
No matter the level of your compatibility, as time progresses, the stressors of life and their lazy friend, Habit, take their toll. I find it irresponsible to not have a set procedure for looking back on various timespans and acknowledging and praising the good, while setting goals and guardrails against the suboptimal.

Given my years in a corporate environment (which weirdly includes high-school, topic for another article), I have been exposed to/subjected to/inflicted review cycles. They are stressful procedures, regardless of how well they turn out in the end.

I thank my lucky stars I have found a partner that agrees on the importance on implementing a similar process for relationships. Not only do we agree they are necessary, we find it quite <mark>romantic</mark>.<br/> How, you ask? Well, Bruno Mars can keep [listing all the hypothetical deadly dangers](https://genius.com/Bruno-mars-grenade-lyrics) he'd subject himself to for love, I will prove my love with the romantic gesture of applying _actual_ effort and intent to keeping the relationship healthy, no matter how annoying and/or boring the proess might be.
