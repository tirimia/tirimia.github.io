How often have you opened a file, seen something you dislike greatly, then started cussing at the git blame?

For total transparency: that used to be me all the time.

<mark class="alt-mark">As the adage goes: If everyone else seems to be the problem, it's you who is the problem.</mark>

Keeping that in mind, and as an exercise in pre-emptive empathy, I devised some methods by which I can keep my sanity while working on a shared codebase that I will now share with you in the hopes that they will serve you too.

## Understanding
### Context

To better think of the context that code was written in, ask yourself the following questions:
      - was the PO cracking the whip especially hard for that feature?
      - did the author receive proper onboarding in the team's style or (god-forbid) the programming language/paradigm itself?
      - were the specifications for that feature remotely intelligible?
      - what is actually the blast radius of the perceived problem?
      - what was your level of experience at when writing that ?

## Prevention

Personally, if I go through anything I consider unpleasant, I strive to make the world a better place by preventing others from experiencing the same.

### Form a connection with the reader/reviewer
We all know when we're cutting corners or are simply working around our ignorance. <mark>Don't be ashamed of it</mark>. If you find yourself in a position to write code you know is not remotely close to your best, or maybe just confusing due to the structure you find yourself force into, _leave a comment_.

Comments don't take long to write, and the moment someone else lays eyes on your work, they can immediately empathize with your pain. Moreover, if your comment is descriptive enough, you've just saved them a bunch of time they would have otherwise spent researching, reading and/or cursing your name. This way, you have turned potential frustration into gratitude and cameraderie.
