title: URI
---
Short for `Uniform Resource Identifier`. It is a simple way to identify resources, whether physical or on a network.

Add a protocol on how to reach it over the network and you have a [URL](./url.md). Even though URIs are techically a
superset of URLs, in day to day speech they are interchangeable.
