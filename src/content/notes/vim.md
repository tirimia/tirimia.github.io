Vim is a text editor that is used for editing files on the command line. It is a modal editor, meaning that you can edit text in one mode and then switch to another mode to edit the same text.

Many pieces of software use Vim as their default text editor, and some even have plugins that allow Vim-like editing in their interfaces.
