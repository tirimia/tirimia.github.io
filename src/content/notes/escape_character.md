title: Escape Character
---

Representing newlines, tabs, and other special characters in a string is a common task.
Using only [ascii](./ascii.md) characters, we can represent these special concepts typically with a backslash followed by a (typically mnemonic) character. They can also be used to represent numbers, like `\x1f` for the [hex](./number_base.md) value `0x1f`.

For example, to represent a newline, we use `\n`.
