title: Dependency Injection
draft: true
---
Dependency Injection is a [design pattern](./design_patterns.md) that allows you to decouple the dependencies (internal logic kind, not external [libraries](./libraries.md)) of a [class](./classes.md) from its implementation.

This is done by passing the dependencies to the [constructor](./constructors.md) of the class.
