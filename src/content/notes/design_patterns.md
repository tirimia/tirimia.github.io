Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that occur in software design. They are not specific to any programming language, but rather are general solutions that can be applied to many different languages.

A common name you will encounter in the field of design patterns is "Gang of Four". The Gang of Four were the four developers that wrote [the first book on design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns), which was published in 1994. The book is titled "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software".
