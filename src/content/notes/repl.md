title: REPL

A REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) is a computer program that reads an expression, evaluates it, prints the result of the evaluation, and then loops back to the beginning.

REPLs are often used to test code, and are a great way to learn how a language works.

Languages such as [Haskell](./haskell.md), [Python](./python.md), and [JavaScript](./javascript.md) all have REPLs - notice how all of them are [interpreted](./intepreted_language.md) languages.
