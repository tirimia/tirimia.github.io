title: XY Problem
---

The XY problem is a simple, yet common, problem in software development and life in general. When someone does not know how to solve problem X, they sometimes think that if they solve problem Y, they can solve X too. This leads to them asking for help with problem Y, which comes across as weird or confusing to anyone trying to help.

If you find yourself helping someone with a weird issue, first make sure that you dig deeper to find out what the actual fundamental problem is.
