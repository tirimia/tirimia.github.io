title: Semantic Versioning
---

Semantic versioning is a set of rules that describe how one should write software versions to avoid problems with compatibility and breaking changes.

## Format
Fundamentally, it looks like : `<major>.<minor>.<patch>[-optional-labels]`

Every modification should increment the version. When you increment each part of the version is up to which changes you made:

  - *Major* - Breaking changes
  - *Minor* - New features that are backwards compatible
  - *Patch* - Backward compatible bug fixes
