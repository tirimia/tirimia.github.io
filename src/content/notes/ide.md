An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger.

IDEs are typically used for developing software, but they can also be used for other tasks, such as document editing.
