Dictionaries are a way to store data in a key-value format, like a real world dictionary.

The keys are always unique, and the values can be anything we choose.

Dictionaries rely on [hashing](./hashing.md) the key to determine where the value is stored in memory. Therefore they are very fast to access as we don't have to search through the entire dictionary.
