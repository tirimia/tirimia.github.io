Markdown is a [markup language](./markup_language.md) that is easy to read and write.

It is used in a wide variety of places, including [GitHub](./github.md) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/).

All the notes in [this page](./azubinomicon.mdx) are written in Markdown.

It comes in multiple flavors, based on which plugins were used to render it.
