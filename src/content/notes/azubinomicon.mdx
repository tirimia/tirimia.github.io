_**Per Astro ad lunam**_[^1]

Code snippets are fun
```typescript
type Note = {
    title: string;
    tags: string[];
    draft?: boolean;
    content: string;
};
```

This note documents what went into making this webpage, in an attempt to show you how much of the theory presented in the other notes matters.

[^1]: "Per"="through/by way of"
"Astro"="proper noun"
"ad"="to/towards"
"lunam"="accusative case of `luna` (moon), indicating it's the destination"
