title: Set theory
---

Set theory is the branch of mathematical logic that studies sets.

Sets are basically collections of objects.

Examples:
  - natural numbers
  - people who are born in the month of January
  - brands of potatoes with a minimum 5% dirt by weight

## Membership notation
We use the `a ∈ A` shorthand to represent `a` being part of the `A` set
## Operations
### Union - A ∪ B
All objects in A, B or both
### Intersection - A ∩ B
Objects of both A *and* B
### Difference A \ B
All members of A that are not members of B
### Symmetric difference A △ B
Member of *exactly* one of the sets
### Cartesian product A x B
All possible pairs in the shape (a,b) where a
## Types
### Subset A ⊆ B
Subsets are sets that *completely* fit within other sets.

E.g.: `{0,1}` is a subset of `{0,1,2}`, and so is `{1,2}`

### Superset
Supersets *completely* encompass other sets

`{"m", "i", "t"}` is a superset of `{"t"}`
