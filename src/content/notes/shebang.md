Shebangs are a way to tell the operating system which program to run.

They are a line at the top of a file that starts with `#!`.

For example, the shebang for a common shell script is `#!/bin/bash`.

<mark>Real pros</mark> use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` so that the script finds `bash` in [$PATH](./environment_variables.md)
